  <p>The church is divided into east and west. The first patriarchs of Constantinople were the bishops. One big disagreement that arose was the holy trinity. People had different opinions on the unity of the godhead. The West started a creed that said they were all equal in power the father and the son. Icons were also a big issue, since people like images but also Idolatry was a big nono. The Byzantine people their salvation depended on understanding of go and the bible. Their opinions led to conflict and leaders were kicked out[excommunicated] of the church. This leads to where we are going next.</p>

<p>This is the Hagia Sophia. It is an important part of the Turkish church. Anyways the growing conflict led to a schism [a separation] in the church. Even though they had separated they still had some sames. </p>
